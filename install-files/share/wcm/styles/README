How the color scheme works:

Colors are defined by a set of the statements in the rules text:
CONTROL_CLASSID@ITEMID:CONDITION[:CONDITION2...] {COLOR_NAME: 0xBBGGRR; ...}

ITEMID and CONDITION are optional, and can be omitted. To define default colorset for all classes
that are not explicitly defined in the rules use '*' for CONTROL_CLASSID
