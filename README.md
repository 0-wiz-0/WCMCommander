=============================

The purpose of this project is to create a multi-platform open source file manager (Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, OS X) mimicking the 
look-n-feel of Far Manager.

Currently WCM Commander runs on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and on OS X using XQuartz.

=============================

Getting the latest version:
---------------------------

The most feature complete up-to-date version is in the [master](https://github.com/corporateshark/WCMCommander/commits/master) branch.
However, this is mostly untested and can be broken from time to time (not for long).
If you want a stable release for a day to day usage, check out our latest [releases](https://github.com/corporateshark/WCMCommander/releases) or
precompiled [binary packages](http://wcm.linderdaum.com/downloads).
