=============================

The purpose of this project is to create a multi-platform open source file manager (Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, OS X) mimicking the 
look-n-feel of Far Manager.

Currently Wal Commander runs on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and on OS X using XQuartz.

=============================
